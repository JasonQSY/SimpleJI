# SimpleJI

It is a Chrome extension to simplify the button of UM-SJTU JI course-chosen website.

## Problem

The original 'Course Selection' is very hard to use. I have to try several times to click it. Meanwhile, some icons are unnecessary.

## Usage

If you do not want the source code, just download the release version is ok.

## Tips

The source code is very ugly and I wrote it just because the website is really hard to use. If you are interested in it, please fork it and improve it.
