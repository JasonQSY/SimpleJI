# SimpleJI

> The project is deprecated now since JI does not use its old course selection website any more.

It is a Chrome extension to simplify the button of UM-SJTU JI course-chosen website.

## Problem

The original 'Course Selection' is very hard to use. I have to try several times to click it. Meanwhile, some icons are unnecessary.

## Usage

If you do not want the source code, just download the release version is ok.

Go to [Google Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simpleji-%E5%AF%86%E9%99%A2%E9%80%89%E8%AF%BE%E7%BD%91%E7%AE%80%E5%8C%96/cnigahobbdabgapnnfklmnmnmhacbhdg/related?hl=en-US) (Blocked by you know who).

## Tips

The source code is very ugly and I wrote it just because the website is really hard to use. If you are interested in it, please fork it and improve it.
